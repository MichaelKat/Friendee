A Social Connection App Prototype!

This is a project that was completed in a team of five in CSC318 - The Design of Interactive Computational Media. There were many aspects and phases to the project, most of which I will attempt to summarize here! 

Please also check out the Friendee Poster in this repository, which provides a great visual summary, and check out the prototype at work over [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/TQDIZLnCYlrVyAIC7Eqw9jm0/Consonants?node-id=62%3A61&viewport=-5128%2C2079%2C1.15954&scaling=scale-down)!

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

The problem space we were investigating is social disconnection, and how people maintain meaningful relationships. Our target audience was university students, between the ages of 18-24. We were mainly looking at the technological factors that contribute to social disconnection and the use of social media in facilitating these relationships. We found that there are severe problems when trying to initiate a plan and during the planning process itself too, often times due to uncertainty and schedule conflicts. Therefore, our solution addresses these aspects by implementing an interface that streamlines the event planning process, along with other features considered.

<h3>Research Method</h3>

Our team worked through multiple phases of research about our problem space and possible solutions. Starting with research papers, we gained insight on scheduling between friends, learning that while people would like to share their availabilities with each other, people want to maintain a degree of privacy in how their calendars are shown to others. We then received over 210 responses from university students through our questionnaires, as well as conducted half hour long interviews with various students. We learned that our audience shows high use of social media when initiating and organizing plans with peers; however, they often face hesitation when considering initiating the meet up, and major barriers to making plans were scheduling conflicts and inability to decide what to do. From these insights, we created an experience map, personas and scenarios, as well as design requirements in order to get a better idea of what our solution would look like, based on user needs. Some examples of potential users we considered were “Shy Shelly” and “Busy Buster”; we got in the mindset of a shy user and a busy user to determine they would need to improve planning processes - we noted their potential needs, desires, habits, and more.

<h3>Findings & Design Implications</h3>

First we designed the low-fidelity prototype using the research findings we have gathered up to that point. The project's design approach was user-centric, so we took our low-fidelity prototype and proceeded to conduct expert reviews and usability testing. Needless to say, our low-fidelity prototype had an abundance of flaws, all of which were documented and corrected. We used the gathered feedback to redesign our prototype and once again, conducted expert reviews and usability testing. This iterative evaluation approach allowed us to develop the best fit product over the course of multiple sessions. In the end, we achieved our final high-fidelity prototype, whose successful aspects are outlined below. Of course, there were more failures than successes, but to describe them here would be inefficient - more details can be provided upon request, though, if interested!

Users were very fond of the “status” capability of the profile, which offers users both personalization and a functional way to communicate some information up front. Additionally, everyone found the navigation through the prototype intuitive and simple, which is most definitely a success. Users enjoyed the fact that the prototype gets straight to the point and does not deviate to “funky” functionality. Overall, the prototype is quite successful as it met user needs and clearly conveyed its functionality during all usability tests.

Users did not appear to face any particular challenges, and there were no particular pain points - only some recommendations and observations on how to make the design better and “smoother”. Users did “stall” on the planning page, but most likely because it is the page with the most components and most details to take into account - a little experience with the layout rapidly proved to eliminate that stalling.

<h3>Discussion of Research Limitations</h3>

The main limitation of our research was that our solution strived to facilitate the interaction between two or more people, but usability testing only allowed us to observe one person interacting with the prototype. This being said, we were able to decently assess the quality of our design in terms of “solo” actions, such as navigation, clicking, reading, and so on, but we were not able to assess our solution in “real-world” scenarios where more than one user must be taken into account, such as conflict resolutions with other people, messaging, and so on. The next step would most likely be releasing a minimum viable product of the solution that would allow users to interact with each other, and then adjust the solution’s design as per user feedback.

<h3>Reflections</h3>

Originally, we wanted to implement as many options as possible, thinking that doing so will give our users the freedom to approach the planning process as freely and easily as possible. However, it turned out that it is not ideal and is actually confusing. It is better to keep things straight and concise, and limit paths to only one instance such that users do not get confused and lost. This impacted our design in such ways that we had to separate some ideas/paths into different pages so that the users can clearly differentiate them and not get confused, and we had to remove some navigation to, once again, reduce confusion.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

In conclusion, this prototype is a mere idea which would require much more work to achieve fruition. And yet, we hope that our idea will potentially someday allow students like us to effectively maintain and strengthen their relationships by connecting in truly meaningful ways. After all, this solution does have advantages over the current state of affairs as it simplifies the two hardest steps to any meetup: initiating a meetup and solidifying meetup details.


If you've gotten this far, I thank you for your time! I hope you learned something new and useful! :)
